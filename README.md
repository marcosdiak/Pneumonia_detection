# Pneumonia detection

`
I've created a high accuracy model using Machine Learning and neural networks to diagnose pneumonia reading chest X-ray images.

## Overview

- `images`: folder contains representative images from this project.
- `models`: folder contains the json file with the final model.history details and the url to get the trained model.
- `presentation`: folder contains the file used for presenting this project.
- `X-ray code.ipynb`: contains all the code.

## Data details

Data downloaded from ([kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/metadata)).

- 5,863 images.
- 2 categories: PNEUMONIA, NORMAL.

The final model was trained in kaggle notebooks using GPU.
